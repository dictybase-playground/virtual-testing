# Background

In the Dicty Stock Center web app, our [catalog pages](https://eric.dictybase.dev/stockcenter/strains) use an infinite scrolling technique to display our full list of stocks.

<Image src={current} height={400} />

---

## Libraries Originally Used

- `react-window`
- `react-window-infinite-loader`
- `react-virtualized-auto-sizer`

---

## Reasons for Change

- More code complexity due to required nested render props patterns
- React has moved to a hooks-based approach
- Increased bundle size (combined > 10kb gzipped)

  <Image src={virtualCode} height={400} width={329} />
</center>

---

## Possible Solution?

The `react-virtual` hook library seemed promising as a replacement at first, but a
deeper dive showed its own set of problems:

- Very poor documentation
- Little to no unit tests
- Not clear how it actually works internally

---

## The Solution

After reading into how infinite scrolling works, we discovered that it is actually
quite simple in its most basic form.

Why don't we just write our own library?

## Infinite Scrolling

- Alternative to pagination
- Loads content continuously as user scrolls down

---

## Potential Flaws

- Performance issue when displaying upwards of 10,000 items
- Every row is rendered to the DOM

<Image src={dom} height={400} />

---

## List Virtualization

In order to prevent all list items from rendering to the DOM, we can use a concept
called "list virtualization" (or "windowing").

- All data is inserted into JavaScript state memory
- Only the items shown in the viewport are inserted into the DOM, the rest remains
  in JS state

## useInfiniteScroll

<Split style={{ textAlign: "left", height: "auto" }}>

<div>
  This hook requires two `useEffect` methods.
  <ol>
    <li>
      Attaches scroll event listener to parent ref, then sets `isFetching`
      boolean when the bottom of the container is reached.
    </li>
    <br />
    <li>
      Fires off a callback function to fetch more data when `isFetching` is
      true.
    </li>
  </ol>
</div>

<center>
  <Image src={useInfiniteScroll} height={450} width={500} />
</center>

</Split>

This solution was inspired by this [blog post](https://upmostly.com/tutorials/build-an-infinite-scroll-component-in-react-using-react-hooks).

## useInfiniteScroll Demo

<ApolloProvider client={client}>
  <InfiniteListContainer />
</ApolloProvider>

---

## Issues

- _Hundreds_ of scroll events are fired on a single scroll
- Needs throttling or debouncing to minimize the damage

Good news... this approach is now completely unnecessary with the new
[IntersectionObserver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API) Web API!

## Intersection Observer

From [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API):

The Intersection Observer API provides a way to asynchronously observe changes in the intersection of a target element with an ancestor element or with a top-level documentâ€™s viewport.

## useIntersectionObserver

<Split style={{ textAlign: "left", height: "auto" }}>

<div>
  This hook requires one <em>useEffect</em> method.
  <ul>
    <li>
      This creates a new <em>IntersectionObserver</em> that observes a target
      ref.
    </li>
    <br />
    <li>
      When the target and root elements are intersecting, a boolean is set to
      true. This is then used by the component as guidance to load more data.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<center>
  <Image src={useIntersectionObserver} height={600} width={500} />

</Split>

## Virtualization Attempt

Using the `IntersectionObserver` would work well for some of our use cases, but
it is not a good solution when displaying all 20,000+ strains in our catalog.

For this, we need to use some type of list virtualization.

---

## useVirtualList Steps

1. Calculate start index and end index for each row
2. Add optional overscan to render additional hidden elements above and below container
3. Attach scroll event listener to the parent ref which updates the `scrollTop` state
   on scroll. This measures how far the inner container is scrolled.
4. Return an array of items with each one containing the index of the data array to display,
   as well as the absolute styling for that row.

## Combination

Wait... these work great solo, now we need to combine them?!?
